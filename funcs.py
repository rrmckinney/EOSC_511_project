"""Calculate the values of surface height (h) and east-west velocity
(u) in a dish of water where a point disturbance of h initiates waves.
Use the simplified shallow water equations on a non-staggered grid.

This is an implementation of lab7 section 4.3.

Example usage from the notebook::

from numlabs.lab7 import rain
# Run 5 time steps on a 9 point grid
rain.rain(5,9)

Example usage from the shell::

  # Run 5 time steps on a 9 point grid
  $ rain.py 5 9

The graph window will close as soon as the animation finishes.  And
the default run for 5 time steps doesn't produce much of interest; try
at least 100 steps.

Example usage from the Python interpreter::

  $ python
  ...
  >>> import rain
  >>> # Run 200 time steps on a 9 point grid
  >>> rain.rain((200, 9))
